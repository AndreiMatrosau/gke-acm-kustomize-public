# Repo used for enabling ACM on GKE clusters

This project is used in the blog article ["GCP: Enable Anthos Config Management (ACM) on a GKE cluster"](https://fabianlee.org/2022/04/19/gcp-enable-anthos-config-management-acm-on-a-gke-cluster/)

This repo is named "gke-acm-kustomize-public" while the git repo used in the article is named "gke-acm-kustomize-private", but the code is exactly the same.  

The private repo is used to illustrate how we can create an ssh secret to access the git repo.
